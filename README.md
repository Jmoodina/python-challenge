# Project Completion Report: Python Financial Analysis and Vote Counting Scripts

## PyBank: Financial Analysis Script

## Objective:
The objective of PyBank was to create a Python script to analyze financial records from the budget_data.csv dataset, calculating key metrics.

### Steps Completed:

1. Read and Load Dataset:

Implemented Python code to read and load the budget_data.csv dataset, consisting of "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns.
2. Calculate Total Months:

Developed code to calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.
3. Calculate Net Total Amount:

Created code to compute the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
4. Calculate Changes and Average Change:

Computed the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
Calculated the average of those changes.
5. Identify Greatest Increase and Decrease:

Developed code to identify the month and amount for the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period.
6. Print and Export Results:

Printed the financial analysis results to the terminal.
Exported a text file with the analysis results.

## PyPoll: Vote Counting Script
### Objective:
The goal of PyPoll was to create a Python script to modernize the vote-counting process using the election_data.csv dataset.

### Steps Completed:

1. Read and Load Dataset:
Implemented Python code to read and load the election_data.csv dataset, containing "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate" columns.

2. Calculate Total Votes:
Developed code to calculate the total number of votes cast.

3. List Candidates and Calculate Percentages:
Created code to generate a list of candidates who received votes.
Calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won.

4. Calculate Total Votes per Candidate:
Computed the total number of votes each candidate won.

5. Identify Winner:
Developed code to identify the winner of the election based on popular vote.

6. Print and Export Results:
Printed the election results to the terminal.
Exported a text file with the analysis results.

## Conclusion:
Both PyBank and PyPoll scripts have been successfully completed, providing accurate financial analysis and vote counting results. The Python scripts are designed to be reusable, enhancing efficiency in future analyses.

### Notes
PyBank Extra Information: 
I was unable to match the average resulted posted on the module assignment.
I wrote notes on my step by step coding with pybank in my coding file. 

I used coding I found on stack overflow to create a text file and put the results in them.

PyPoll Extra Information:
The coding I used for PyBank which creates a text file I also used for creating the textfile on PyPoll.

I also learned how to split lines for the text file from an outside source:
