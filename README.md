 Joshua Modina's attempt at the PyBank, PyPoll coding assignment

PyBank Extra Information: 
I was unable to match the average resulted posted on the module assignment.
I wrote notes on my step by step coding with pybank in my coding file. 

I used coding I found on stack overflow to create a text file and put the results in them.

PyPoll Extra Information:
The coding I used for PyBank which creates a text file I also used for creating the textfile on PyPoll.

I also learned how to split lines for the text file from an outside source:

Thank you, do let me know if you need more information or if I forgot anything.
